## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Boot from official Arch Linux ISO
- Connect to internet (ethernet auto, or use `iwctl` for WiFi)
- UEFI or BIOS systems supported

### Quick Install
```bash
# Download the installer directly
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mansminus/CustomArchInstall/main/install.sh

# Make it executable and run
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

### Alternative Download
```bash
# Using wget instead of curl
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mansminus/CustomArchInstall/main/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

### New Structure (Configs externalized)
- The installer now sources configuration templates from `configs/` instead of embedding them in `install.sh`.
- If you clone the repo, the script will copy `configs/` into the target and render them via envsubst.
- If you only download `install.sh`, it will fetch the repository archive at runtime to obtain `configs/`.

Key locations used during install:
- System templates: `/tmp/installer/configs/system/...`
- User templates: `/tmp/installer/configs/user/...`
